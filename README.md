# meetingspace

This app allows the user to book a room at a given time, for a chosen duration, with a number of constraints.

It's an autonomous web app and it connects to an API.

It's a [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) app written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Requirements

A recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (preferably v18) installed on your machine.

## Development

This app was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) using the `react-swc-ts` preset.

To install the dependencies, run the following command from your console:

> I really recommend using pNPM, it's much faster than any other alternative.

```
$ pnpm i
```

Then, to start the development server:

```
$ pnpm dev
```

Of course you can also use plain old npm (or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) if you have it):

```
$ npm i && npm run dev
```
